# rust-is
Experimental Rust image server. Mostly for me to learn a bit more Rust (and Axum), though I may also end up using it in personal projects later.



## Planned Features

* Image storage and retrieval backed by Postgres
* Simple image manipulation via query parameters (e.g resizing)
* Image conversion to allow serving images in different formats
